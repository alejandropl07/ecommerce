        description: "First known as the Vans #36, the Old Skool debuted in 1977 with a unique new addition: a random doodle drawn by founder Paul Van Doren, and originally referred to as the “jazz stripe.” Today, the famous Vans Sidestripe has become the unmistakable—and instantly recognizable—hallmark of the Vans brand. Constructed with durable suede and canvas uppers in a range of fresh colorways, the Old Skool pays homage to our heritage while ensuring that this low top, lace-up shoe remains as iconic as ever. It also features re-enforced toe caps, supportive padded collars, and signature rubber waffle outsoles."

        description: "The Apple MacBook Pro 2021 (14-inch) is an important laptop. And that's not only because of what it has but also for what it erases. The marquee features start with the M1 Pro chip, a seriously super-charged upgrade over the M1 chips that upped speeds and battery life last year."
